# TODO

- [ ] add a `rowRender` method to add a custom rendering for the rows. If this is used, the row is rendered inside a `<div>`. This allows custom rendering implementations.
- [ ] Solve "Storybook lost connection" issue
  - https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/28258
- [ ] add searching deboucing.
- [ ] add support for toggle mode visualization, so user can choose weather to toggle if he want to see data in the table, in cards, grid, etc.
  - its probably better delegate this responsibility of render to the dev consuming this lib.
